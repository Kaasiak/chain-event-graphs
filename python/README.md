`event_tree_class.py` - creates an event tree, staged tree and a Chain Event Graph (CEG) objects from a data frame. This is an extended implementation of the code developed by [Aditi Shenvi](https://github.com/ashenvi10/Chain-Event-Graphs)

`tree2tex.py` - defines a `converter` object for transforming xdot output from `Graphviz` to a series of `PGF/TikZ` commands for a friendly LaTeX look. It relies on the `dot2tex` converter and adds extra post-processing steps.

`report_model.ipynb` - notebook containing graphs generated for the final report.
